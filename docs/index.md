# Interactive volcanic fatalities map

Click on the link below to launch in your browser, an interactive cluster marker map of the volcanic fatalities database from Brown et al. (2015). Zooming in on areas of interest and clicking on the blue markers will give information on the number of fatalities for a particular eruption along with its start year and the name of the volcano.

This is Version 1 of the database, meaning it has not been updated since 2015. For eruptions where fatalities were recorded in multiple locations there will be mulitple markers.
 
 The journal article describing the data is freely available [here](https://appliedvolc.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13617-017-0067-4).
